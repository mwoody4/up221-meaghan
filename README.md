## About Me

My name is Meaghan Woody and I'm a first-year PhD Student in Community Health Sciences within the Fielding School of Public Health. My research interests lie at the intersection of diet-related disparities and immigrant health. More specifically, I am interested in the dietary acculturation of Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and their diaspora, and the risk of diet-related NCDs. 

## Course Description

UP 221 is introduces students to the foundations of spatial data science using Python.

## Personal Class Objectives

My objectives for this course are to: learn how to use python for mapping, learn how to create publishable maps and figures, and apply these skills to future projects to answer research questions with a spatial component. I have taken courses in GIS and spatial epidemiology using ArcGIS and R, respectively, and I am interested to see how Python will compare.

## Project Ideas

- How is distance to food markets (or defined food deserts) associated with disbursement and proportions of immigrants in the community?
- How does distance to food markets affect the health of immigrants?
- How does distance/access to ethnic and culturally-concordant food retailers improve health and diet outcomes?
