# up221-meaghan

My name is Meaghan Woody. I'm a first-year PhD Student in Community Health Sciences within the Fielding School of Public Health. My research interests lie at the intersection of diet-related disparities and immigrant health. More specifically, I am interested in the dietary acculturation of Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and their diaspora, and the risk of diet-related NCDs. 

Course description:
UP 221 is introduces students to the foundations of spatial data science using Python.

**Objectives:
**My object for this course are to: learn how to use python for mapping, learn how to create publishable maps and figures, and apply these skills to future projects to answer research questions with a spatial component. I have taken courses in GIS and spatial epidemiology using ArcGIS and R respectively and I am interested to see how Python 

**Project ideas:
**Distance to food markets (or defined food deserts) by census tracts in Los Angeles County and how it is associated with disbursement and proportions of immigrants in the community. How does distance to food markets affect the health of immigrants? How does distance/access to ethnic and culturally-concordant food retailers improve health and diet outcomes?
