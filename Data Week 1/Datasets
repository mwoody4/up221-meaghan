County of Los Angeles Enterprise GIS - Concentrated Disadvantage Index 2022

This dataset maps one variable, Concentrated Disadvantage Index (CDI), across LA County based on 2020 5 year ACS variables. The index was used by the ACS to calculate the “proportion of households located in census tracts with a high level of concentrated disadvantage, using five census variables”. The CDI could be an interesting measure to study access to affordable healthy foods.
